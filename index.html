								of the page. Blog post about my experience with the challenge can be found 
								<a href =https://blog.pmarcinkevicius.com/my-journey-with-the-cloud-resume-challenge/>here. </a> <br>

							<h3>Installed/Configured Home Lab server, using various hardware as well as Unraid OS. Serving multiple functionalities, such as

								Most services that the server delivers are via Docker containers to provide lower admin overhead and streamlined upkeep. <br>
